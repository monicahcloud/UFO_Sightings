# UFO_Sightings
Create a Web Page with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js to Create Tables Dynamically Utilizing Document Object Model (DOM) Programming Interface Based on a Given Dataset

JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation
This project is a simple example of using D3 to manipulate the DOM and create a table from a small amount of data stored in a JavaScript file. The user can filter the data by any number of parameters and the app.js file will manipulate the DOM and create a table based on the filters.

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 


Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.



Level 2: Multiple Search Categories



Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
